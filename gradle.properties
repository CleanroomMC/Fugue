# Access Transformers
# A way to change visibility of Minecraft's classes, methods and fields
# An example access transformer file is given in the path: `src/main/resources/example_at.cfg`
# AT files should be in the root of src/main/resources with the filename formatted as: `mod_id_at.cfg`
# Use the property `access_transformer_locations` to state custom AT files if you aren't using the default `mod_id_at.cfg` location
# If multiple locations are stated, use spaces as the delimiter
# WARNING: Use MCP name in AT file. Unimined will remap it to srg name when building.

# Coremods
# The most powerful way to change java classes at runtime, it is however very primitive with little documentation.

# You MUST state a class name for `coremod_plugin_class_name` if you are making a coremod, the class should implement `IFMLLoadingPlugin`
